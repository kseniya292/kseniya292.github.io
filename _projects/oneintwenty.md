This project was done in collaboration with graphic design students from Syracuse University in the 2016 Pixel & Print project. As project manager, I was the liason between the client and our team of developers who worked on rebuilding the One in Twenty site with template customization using Squarespace. 

The most challeneing part of this project was incorporating a form for user submissions that linked to the client's dropbox.When a user submits a form and uploads documents, the information and attached documents are placed directly into the client's dropbox account.
