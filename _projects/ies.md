This project was the design and development of a website for the Syracuse chapter of the Illuminating Engineering Society organization. The national IES office requires chapters to use a template so the design was based off their theme. 
The challenge with designing this was staying consistent with the IES brand and template while making it look modern and sleek.

This was built in Wordpress using a custom theme.
