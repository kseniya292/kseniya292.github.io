This project is a redesign and development of a new e-commerce website for Olive on Brooklea, a local Olive Oil and Vinegar shop. The client is currently using Yahoo to maintain their website. 

This is a joint project with <a href="http://zck.io">Zoe Koulouris</a>. We redesigned the site using a fresh, modern layout that was mobily responsive. We created a custom theme using Wordpress as the CMS, and integrated woocommerce for the e-commerce portion. 

This project in currently in production and will be live soon.
